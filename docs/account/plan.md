# Introduction

D2C does not provide its computing resources â€“ it automates the provisioning process at cloud providers. Be aware that cloud provider will charge you for resource usage based on your payment plan.

2. **Private cloud** means the ability to run D2C platform in your environment.
3. You can not change Pro plan to Free yourself. [Contact us](mailto:support@d2c.io) if you want to do it. The account should have not more than one cloud host up to 1GB RAM.
